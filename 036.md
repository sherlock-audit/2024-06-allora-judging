# Insufficient Error Handling in Sorting Functions in `math/utils.go`


## Summary
The absence of error handling in `GetSortedKeys` can lead to incorrect sorting and thus incorrect data.

## Vulnerability Detail
The sorting functions GetSortedKeys and GetSortedElementsByDecWeightDesc do not handle errors that may occur during the sorting process. This can lead to incorrect sorting results or runtime errors.


## Impact
If an error occurs during sorting, it will not be handled, potentially leading to incorrect sorting results or runtime errors. This can affect the correctness of the application.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement error handling to capture and manage errors during the sorting process. Ensure that errors are logged and handled appropriately to maintain the correctness of the application.
