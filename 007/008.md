# Concurrency Issues with Goroutines in `topics_handler.go`

## Summary
There is no proper synchronization mechanism in requestTopicWorkers and requestTopicReputers. This can lead to race conditions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The requestTopicWorkers and requestTopicReputers functions use goroutines to perform concurrent operations without adequate synchronization or error handling. This can lead to race conditions, data corruption, and unpredictable behavior.

## Impact
Concurrent operations without proper synchronization can cause race conditions, leading to inconsistent or incorrect data states. This can affect the integrity of the blockchain operations and lead to potential security vulnerabilities.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement proper synchronization mechanisms such as mutexes or channels to handle concurrency. Ensure that shared data is protected and errors from goroutines are properly captured and handled.
