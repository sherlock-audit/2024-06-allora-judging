# Inconsistent Handling of Zero Standard Deviation in `rewards_internal.go`


## Vulnerability Detail

In the `GetMappingFunctionValues` function, there's an issue with how the code handles situations where the standard deviation (`stdDev`) of the `latestTimeStepsScores` is less than `epsilon` (or zero).

The problematic section is:


```go
if stdDev.Lt(epsilon) {
    // ... return the plain value 1 for everybody ...
}
```

In this case, the function returns an array filled with `alloraMath.OneDec()`, essentially assigning the same score to every worker. However, this doesn't accurately reflect the formula in the comment:

```go
M(T) = φ_p (abs[ T / σ(T) + ɛ])
```

If `stdDev` is zero (or very close to zero), the division `T / σ(T)` becomes undefined or extremely large, leading to a result that doesn't align with the intended mapping.

**Consequences**

This can skew the reward calculations significantly, as the mapping function values won't be accurately reflecting the worker scores relative to the standard deviation. This can lead to:

- **Unfair Rewards:** Workers might receive disproportionately high or low rewards compared to their actual performance.
- **Disincentivizing Improvement:** If workers see that their efforts don't result in meaningful reward differences, it can demotivate them from striving to improve.

**The Fix: Correct Mapping Function Calculation**

To address this, we need to modify the `GetMappingFunctionValues` function to handle the case of low or zero standard deviation more gracefully.
