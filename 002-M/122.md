# `msg_server_demand::FundTopic` passes incorrect additional fee, potentially activate a topic incorrectly

## Summary

`msg_server_demand::FundTopic` may activate a topic incorrectly, due to incorrect usage of the `activateTopicIfWeightAtLeastGlobalMin` function. The topic fee was updated before the `activateTopicIfWeightAtLeastGlobalMin`, but the added fee revenue (= msg.Amount) was passed as additional revenue, resulting in double counting of the added fund for the calculation of the topic weight.


## Vulnerability Detail

When an user calls `FundTopic` to add a fee revenue for a topic, the calculation was done in the order of `AddTopicFeeRevenue(ctx, msg.TopicId, msg.Amount)` -> `activateTopicIfWeightAtLeastGlobalMin(ctx, ms, msg.TopicId, msg.Amount)`:

The `AddTopicFeeRevenue` updates the fee revenue by adding the amount in the parameter:

Then the `activateTopicIfWeightAtLeastGlobalMin` was called with the `msg.Amount` as the last parameter, which will be passed to the `GetCurrentTopicWeight` as the parameter `additionalRevenue`

In the `GetCurrentTopicWeight`, the topicFeeRevenue will be fetched using `GetTopicFeeRevenue` then the `additionalRevenu` will be added to get the newFeeRevenue, this value will be used as the fee revenue upon calculating the weight.

Note the the topic fee revenue fetched by the `GetTopicFeeRevenue` is already updated adding the `msg.Amount` in the `FundTopic`.

As the result the added fund `msg.Amount` will be added twice to calculate the weight. This might lead to activation of a topic, when they should not be activated if the weight is calculated correctly.

## Impact

An incorrect activation of a topic

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Either change the call order to `activateTopicIfWeightAtLeastGloblaMin` -> `AddTopicFeeRevenue`,
or change the parameter of the `activateTopicIfWeightAtLeastGlolbalMin` to `alloraMath.ZeroDec()`.
