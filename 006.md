# Panic on Denomination Registration Failure in `config.go`


## Summary
The RegisterDenoms function calls panic if there is an error during the registration of coin denominations.

## Vulnerability Detail
Using panic for error handling is not a best practice as it causes the application to crash abruptly.

## Impact
If an error occurs during the registration of denominations, the application will panic and terminate, leading to potential downtime and difficulty in debugging the issue.

## Recommendation
Implement proper error handling instead of using panic. Log the error and provide a controlled mechanism to handle failures during denomination registration.
