# Active topics eligible for churning may be skipped due to pagination assuming consecutive topic ids

## Summary
Active topics eligible for churning may be skipped due to pagination assuming consecutive topic ids in `GetIdsOfActiveTopics`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the emissions module `EndBlocker`, the possible topics for churning are initially identified in `GetAndUpdateActiveTopicWeights`. Topics are only considered (added to `weights`) if the current block is the end of an epoch and their topic weight is at least the minimum weight. In `SafeApplyFuncOnAllActiveEpochEndingTopics`, the list of topics that is considered (ie. have `fn` applied to them) is retrieved using pagination in `GetIdsOfActiveTopics`. Note that the initial starting key is always for topic id 0 and `topicPageLimit = maxTopicPages = moduleParams.DefaultPageLimit`, and we continue until either a returned page is empty or we reach `maxTopicPages`.

```go
	topicPageKey := make([]byte, 0)
	i := uint64(0)
	for {
		topicPageRequest := &types.SimpleCursorPaginationRequest{Limit: topicPageLimit, Key: topicPageKey}
		topicsActive, topicPageResponse, err := k.GetIdsOfActiveTopics(ctx, topicPageRequest)
		...
		for _, topicId := range topicsActive {
			...
			if k.CheckCadence(block, topic) {
				// All checks passed => Apply function on the topic
				err = fn(ctx, &topic)
				if err != nil {
					Logger(ctx).Warn(fmt.Sprintf("Error applying function on topic: %s", err.Error()))
					continue
				}
			}
		}

		// if pageResponse.NextKey is empty then we have reached the end of the list
		if topicsActive == nil || i > maxTopicPages {
			break
		}
		topicPageKey = topicPageResponse.NextKey
		i++
	}
```
The issue is `GetIdsOfActiveTopics` assumes that active topics will be consecutive as `nextKey` (the end key for this page exclusive) is `start + limit` e.g. for the first page where `startKey = 0`, `endKey = limit`.

```go
func (k Keeper) GetIdsOfActiveTopics(ctx context.Context, pagination *types.SimpleCursorPaginationRequest) ([]TopicId, *types.SimpleCursorPaginationResponse, error) {
	limit, start, err := k.CalcAppropriatePaginationForUint64Cursor(ctx, pagination)
	...
	startKey := make([]byte, binary.MaxVarintLen64)
	binary.BigEndian.PutUint64(startKey, start)
	nextKey := make([]byte, binary.MaxVarintLen64)
	binary.BigEndian.PutUint64(nextKey, start+limit)

	rng, err := k.activeTopics.IterateRaw(ctx, startKey, nextKey, collections.OrderAscending)
	...
	activeTopics, err := rng.Keys()
	...
	return activeTopics, &types.SimpleCursorPaginationResponse{
		NextKey: nextKey,
	}, nil
}
```
Consequently, `GetIdsOfActiveTopics` as used in `SafeApplyFuncOnAllActiveEpochEndingTopics` will only ever check the consecutive topic ids up to `maxTopicPages * topicPageLimit` ie. any topics with id greater than this will never be churned. Additionally, if in this range there exists at least one page of consecutive topic ids where none are active, the loop in `SafeApplyFuncOnAllActiveEpochsEndingTopics` will terminate (since and active topics with larger ids will not be considered (added to `weights`) or churned despite potentially having greater weight.

## Impact
Topics with large enough id will never be churned, and topics may not be churned and rewarded according to their topic weight (which would negatively impact the incentive structure and supply of inferences relative to demand).

## Recommendation
Iterate with a limit of elements retrieved set to `limit` (and `nil` end key, so we don't skip anything).
