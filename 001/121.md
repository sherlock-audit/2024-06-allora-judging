# `msg_server_stake::AddStake` calculates the weight incorrectly resulting in incorrect activation of a topic

## Summary

Allora calculates the topic's weight based on the stake amount and fee revenue.
In the `msg_server_stake::AddStake` function, the `activateTopicIfWeightAtLeastGlobalMin` was used incorrectly.
It may activate the topic incorrectly.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a reputer send transaction to `AddStake`, at the end of the function, `activateTopicIfWeightAtLeastGlobalMin` will be called:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/keeper/msgserver/msg_server_stake.go#L54

The function will calculate the weight based on updated stake for the reputer and if the weight is large enough, the topic will be activated.

Note that the last input to the call was `msg.Amount` which is the added stake by the reputer.


In the `activateTopicIfWeightAtLeastGlobalMin` will call `GetCurrentTopicWeight` to calcaulate the new weight for the topic,
and use the new weight to determine whether the topic should be activated:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/keeper/msgserver/msg_server_util_topic_activation.go#L28-L36

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/keeper/topic_weight.go#L41-L49

The last input the the `activateTopicIfWeightAtLeastGlobalMin` will be passed to `GetCurrentTopicWeight` as the last parameter.
In the `GetCurrentTopicWeight` uses the last parameter `additionalRevenue` as the added topic fee revenue. It will be added to the existing topic fee revenue and passed to the `GetTargetWeight` as the fee revenue. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/keeper/topic_weight.go#L67-L80

The topic's stake amount will be fetched using `GetTopicStake`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/keeper/topic_weight.go#L50

The topic's stake amount is correct, since the topic's stake was already updated in the `AddStake` function. 

The `GetTargetWeight` will calculate topic weight using both stake of the topic and fee revenue.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/keeper/topic_weight.go#L12-L24

```go
// Return the target weight of a topic
// ^w_{t,i} = S^{μ}_{t,i} * (P/C)^{ν}_{t,i}
// where S_{t,i} is the stake of of topic t in the last reward epoch i
// and (P/C)_{t,i} is the fee revenue collected for performing inference per topic epoch
// requests for topic t in the last reward epoch i
// μ, ν are global constants with fiduciary values of 0.5 and 0.5
```

As the result the added amount of stake will be considered as the fee revenue, and the weight will be calculated accordingly.

## Impact

When a reputer adds stake, it will calculate the topic's weight incorrectly, resulting in incorrect activation of the topic.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

use zero in the place of added fee revenue.

```go
// https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/keeper/msgserver/msg_server_stake.go#L54
-  err = activateTopicIfWeightAtLeastGlobalMin(ctx, ms, msg.TopicId, msg.Amount)
+  err = activateTopicIfWeightAtLeastGlobalMin(ctx, ms, msg.TopicId, alloraMath.ZeroDec())
```
