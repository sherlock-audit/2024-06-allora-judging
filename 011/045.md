# Incorrect highestVotingPower Calculation in argmaxBlockByCount Function Resulting in Incorrect Block Selection

## Summary
The argmaxBlockByCount function is designed to identify the block height with the highest number of reputers voting for it. However, the calculation step for highestVotingPower is missing, leading to incorrect block selection. Specifically, the function updates blockOfMaxPower when a new block with higher voting power is found but does not update highestVotingPower. This oversight results in a failure to properly track the highest voting power and select the correct block.
## Vulnerability Detail
The following code snippet from argmaxBlockByCount illustrates the issue. Lines 9-11 properly calculate blockVotingPower as the count of reputers voting for each block. However, when finding a new highest voting power, only blockOfMaxPower is updated, while highestVotingPower is not, leading to incorrect outcomes.
```go
func (ap *AppChain) argmaxBlockByCount(
	blockToReputer *map[int64][]string,
) int64 {
	firstIter := true
	highestVotingPower := cosmossdk_io_math.ZeroInt()
	blockOfMaxPower := int64(-1)
	for block, reputersWhoVotedForBlock := range *blockToReputer {
		blockVotingPower := cosmossdk_io_math.NewInt(int64(len(reputersWhoVotedForBlock)))
		
		if firstIter || blockVotingPower.GT(highestVotingPower) {
@>			blockOfMaxPower = block // Correctly updates the block
@>			// Missing highestVotingPower = blockVotingPower
		}

		firstIter = false
	}

	return blockOfMaxPower
}
```
## Impact
The function does not accurately identify the block with the highest count of reputers. This misidentification can lead to incorrect block selection, potentially affecting subsequent processing or decision-making processes that rely on these results.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To resolve this issue, update highestVotingPower whenever blockOfMaxPower is updated:
```diff
func (ap *AppChain) argmaxBlockByCount(
	blockToReputer *map[int64][]string,
) int64 {
	firstIter := true
	highestVotingPower := cosmossdk_io_math.ZeroInt()
	blockOfMaxPower := int64(-1)
	for block, reputersWhoVotedForBlock := range *blockToReputer {
		blockVotingPower := cosmossdk_io_math.NewInt(int64(len(reputersWhoVotedForBlock)))
		
		if firstIter || blockVotingPower.GT(highestVotingPower) {
+			highestVotingPower = blockVotingPower  // Update the highest voting power
			blockOfMaxPower = block  // Correctly updates the block
		}

		firstIter = false
	}

	return blockOfMaxPower
}
```
