# Unauthorized Stake & DelegateStake Removal of Reputers or Worker by any User

## Summary
The Allora AppChain's `RemoveStake` and `RemoveDelegateStake` functions, allowing unauthorized users to remove the stakes of any reputer /delegators. This issue arises due to insufficient verification of the message sender's identity and authority

## Vulnerability Detail
The RemoveStake and RemoveDelegateStake functions in the Allora AppChain are designed to allow reputers and delegators to remove their stakes. However, the functions only verify if the message sender is associated with the topic without confirming if the sender is indeed the valid signer of the message or has the authority to perform the stake removal. This lack of proper authentication can be exploited by malicious actors resulting in unauthorized stake removal.

```js
// RemoveStake kicks off a stake removal process. Stake Removals are placed into a delayed queue.
func (ms msgServer) RemoveStake(ctx context.Context, msg *types.MsgRemoveStake) (*types.MsgRemoveStakeResponse, error) {
    if msg.Amount.IsZero() {
        return nil, types.ErrReceivedZeroAmount
    }

    // Check the sender has enough stake already placed on the topic to remove the stake
    stakePlaced, err := ms.k.GetStakeReputerAuthority(ctx, msg.TopicId, msg.Sender)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    delegateStakeUponReputerInTopic, err := ms.k.GetDelegateStakeUponReputer(ctx, msg.TopicId, msg.Sender)
    if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    } 
    // Existing code ...
}
```
## Impact
This vulnerability can have severe impacts on the Allora AppChain, including
1. Potential loss of rewards due to unintended stake removal.
2. Lack of incentive may lead network participants to abandon allora chain.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, it is recommended to implement proper verification of the message sender's identity and authority before allowing the stake removal.
