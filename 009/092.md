# If old coefficient is bigger than the new one then the reputer has it's coeff reduced more than it should

## Summary
If the old coefficient are bigger than the new coefficient, then our reputer's coefficients will be set to smaller value which will be lower than the minimum limit, essentially breaking the `minStakeFraction` invariant.

## Vulnerability
The root cause of this issue is located in `GetAllReputersOutput`, in the place where if `listenedStakeFraction < minStakeFraction` we calculate a custom coeff.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/rewards_internal.go
```go
		if listenedStakeFraction.Lt(minStakeFraction) {
			for l := range coefficients {
				coeffDiff, err := coefficients[l].Sub(oldCoefficients[l])
				if err != nil {
					return nil, nil, err
				}

				listenedDiff, err := minStakeFraction.Sub(listenedStakeFractionOld)
				if err != nil {
					return nil, nil, err
				}

				//@audit what if old > new, then this will be negative ?
				stakedFracDiff, err := listenedStakeFraction.Sub(listenedStakeFractionOld)
				if err != nil {
					return nil, nil, err
				}
```

If our `listenedStakeFractionOld` is bigger than our `listenedStakeFraction` then `stakedFracDiff` will be negative. This value is later used to calculate our new `coefficients` bellow, where we first calculate the diff - `coeffDiffTimesListenedDiff`, then divide it by our fraction diff (where the actual issue is) and finally add it to `oldCoefficients` to get the new `coefficients`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/rewards_internal.go#L560
```go
				if stakedFracDiff.IsZero() {
					i = gradientDescentMaxIters
				} else {
					coeffDiffTimesListenedDiff, err := coeffDiff.Mul(listenedDiff)
					if err != nil {
						return nil, nil, err
					}

					coefDiffTimesListenedDiffOverStakedFracDiff, err := coeffDiffTimesListenedDiff.Quo(stakedFracDiff)
					if err != nil {
						return nil, nil, err
					}

					coefficients[l], err = oldCoefficients[l].Add(coefDiffTimesListenedDiffOverStakedFracDiff)
					if err != nil {
						return nil, nil, err
					}
				}
```

In short, if `listenedStakeFraction` is bellow the min allowed fraction - `minStakeFraction` ([MinStakeFraction in the params](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/scores.go#L81)) then we do some custom math to increase a our reputer coefficient. However as stated above that is not the case when our `listenedStakeFraction` is less than `listenedStakeFractionOld`.

## Path
We got over why it happens, now lets cover the context around it - aka. how it can happen.

[GetAllReputersOutput](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/scores.go#L72-L83) (where the issue is), is called inside [GenerateReputerScores](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/scores.go#L19) in order to calculate our scores and coefficients. Both old and new fractions are calculated with the bellow formulas:

`listenedStakeFractionOld = sum(oldCoefficients * stakes) / sum(stakes)` [code is here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/rewards_internal.go#L526-L537)
`listenedStakeFraction = sum(newCoefficients * stakes) / sum(stakes)` [code is here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/rewards_internal.go#L538-L545)

In order to understand these fractions better we need to look into how they are calculated. `listenedStakeFractionOld` is just the last fraction from the prev. epoch, so I will skip it's math (because it's the same).

Our `newCoefficients` is calculated from [this code snippet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/rewards_internal.go#L509-L523), implementing this formula:
```markdown
min(
   max( 
      coefficient + (learningRate * gradient) 
   , 0) 
, 1)
```

Where:
1. `coefficient` is our old coeff.
2. `learningRate` is a global fixed parameter controlling the rate of system improvement.
3. `gradient` is the variable that can most dramatically change our `newCoefficients`.

`gradient` is calculated with the bellow formula: 
`gradient[i] = (1 - sum(score * stake) / sum(score2 * stake)) / (0.001 || -0.001)` [code is here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/rewards_internal.go#L484-L500)

Where our [dcoeff](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/rewards_internal.go#L462-L465), aka the last part -  `/ (0.001 || -0.001)` will divide our numerator - `(1 - sum(score * stake) / sum(score2 * stake))` by 0.001 or -0.001, based on if our prev. coeff was 1. Division by numbers smaller than 1 is same as multiplication, so this can be interpreted as `* (1000 || -1000)`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/rewards_internal.go#L462-L465
```go
			dcoeff := alloraMath.MustNewDecFromString("0.001")

			if coefficients[l].Equal(alloraMath.OneDec()) {
				dcoeff = alloraMath.MustNewDecFromString("-0.001")
			}
```

With all of that math behind us we can conclude that in order for `listenedStakeFraction` to be less than `listenedStakeFractionOld` our gradient needs to change. The bad news is that our gradient changes on every epoch with every score calculation, as if our prev. coeff was 1, our gradient will flip to negative, impacting slightly `listenedStakeFraction`, potentially making it smaller than `listenedStakeFractionOld`.

## Impact
The effects of all of that are:
1. Breaking of invariant like `minStakeFraction`, as it should increase the fraction slighly when we are bellow `minStakeFraction`, but instead it reduces it even more.
2.  Reducing reputers rewards, by reducing their coefficient more than it should. Rewards are calculated based on scores and scores are calculates with these coefficients.

## Code Snippet
```go
				//@audit what if old > new, then this will be negative ?
				stakedFracDiff, err := listenedStakeFraction.Sub(listenedStakeFractionOld)
                                ...
				} else {
					coeffDiffTimesListenedDiff, err := coeffDiff.Mul(listenedDiff)
					if err != nil {
						return nil, nil, err
					}

					coefDiffTimesListenedDiffOverStakedFracDiff, err := coeffDiffTimesListenedDiff.Quo(stakedFracDiff)
					if err != nil {
						return nil, nil, err
					}

					coefficients[l], err = oldCoefficients[l].Add(coefDiffTimesListenedDiffOverStakedFracDiff)
					if err != nil {
						return nil, nil, err
					}
				}
```

## Recommendation
A good solution would be to `.abs()` the value in order to make sure it is always positive.
