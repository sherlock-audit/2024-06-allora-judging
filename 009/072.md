# `GetAllReputersOutput`: If `listenedStakeFraction < minStakeFraction`, the differential will not be properly interpolated to ensure `listenedStakeFraction = minStakeFraction`

## Summary
If `listenedStakeFraction < minStakeFraction`, the differential will not be properly interpolated to ensure `listenedStakeFraction = minStakeFraction`.

```go
		if listenedStakeFraction.Lt(minStakeFraction) {
			for l := range coefficients {
				coeffDiff, err := coefficients[l].Sub(oldCoefficients[l])
				if err != nil {
					return nil, nil, err
				}
				...
				if stakedFracDiff.IsZero() {
					i = gradientDescentMaxIters
				} else {
					coeffDiffTimesListenedDiff, err := coeffDiff.Mul(listenedDiff)
					if err != nil {
						return nil, nil, err
					}
					coefDiffTimesListenedDiffOverStakedFracDiff, err := coeffDiffTimesListenedDiff.Quo(stakedFracDiff)
					if err != nil {
						return nil, nil, err
					}
					coefficients[l], err = oldCoefficients[l].Add(coefDiffTimesListenedDiffOverStakedFracDiff)
					if err != nil {
						return nil, nil, err
					}
```
In the whitepaper under equation 34, it is mentioned that whenever the fraction of the stake listened to falls below a minimum, the differential is interpolated so that the fraction is equal to the minimum. The corresponding logic is in the above snippet. The issue is `coeffDiff` calculates `coefficients[i] - oldCoefficients[i]`, but at this point `coefficients` always contains the same values as `oldCoefficients` (since `coefficients` is copied into `oldCoefficients` at the start of the outer loop and neither is changed up to this point). Consequently, `coeffDiff` will always be `0` for all coefficients and `coefficients` will not change.

## Impact
Fraction of stake listened to will not be corrected to the minimum if below the minimum, such that the adjusted stake(s) calculated will not be as intended resulting in incorrect distribution of rewards.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate `coeffDiff = newCoefficients[i] - oldCoefficients[i]` instead.
