# `allora-inference-base::SendWorkerModeData` sets nonce from the peer's blockHeight

## Summary

The `SendWorkerModeData` sets nonce for the entire worker data bundles from the first BlockHeight value from its peers.
Any data bundle which does not match with the blockheight from Nonce will be ignored.

## Vulnerability Detail

The lead node will use `appchain::SendWorkerModeData` to collect worker data from peers and sent it to the allora chain via `MsgInsertBulkWorkerPayload`.
When it constructs the data bundle from other peers, it sets the nonce from the `BlockHeight` from peers.
It also does not check whether it agrees with other data from other peers.

In the `InsertBulkWorkerPayload`, every data bundle which does not match the `nonce`'s blockheight will be discarded:

## Impact

In the case the blockheight value from the first peer does not match with other peers, it will force every other work discarded, wasting the computational resource.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider checking the blockheight with other peer's results.
