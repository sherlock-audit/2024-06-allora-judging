# Lack of HTTP Response Status Code Validation

## Summary

The absence of HTTP status code checking poses the following critical risks:

1. Silent Failures:
   - Errors or unexpected responses from the server may go unnoticed.
   - This can lead to the system operating on incorrect assumptions about the success of API calls.

2. Data Integrity Issues:
   - Without verifying a successful response (e.g., 200 OK), the system might process or store incorrect or incomplete data.
   - This could lead to data corruption or inconsistencies across the system.

3. Information Leakage:
   - Error responses (4xx or 5xx status codes) might contain sensitive information that is not properly handled or logged.
   - This could potentially expose internal system details to attackers.

4. Vulnerability to Server-Side Attacks:
   - An attacker who has compromised the server could return malicious responses with non-200 status codes, which would be processed as if they were valid.
   - This could lead to injection attacks or other forms of malicious payload execution.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current implementation of the `makeApiCall` function does not validate the HTTP response status code

## Impact

 By only processing responses with successful status codes, the system can maintain data accuracy and consistency.

## Code Snippet

[api.go#L166](https://github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/blob/3a97afe7af027c96749fac7c4327ae85359a61c8/app/api.go#L166)

```go
func makeApiCall(payload string) error {
	url := os.Getenv("BLOCKLESS_API_URL")
	method := "POST"

	client := &http.Client{}
	req, err := http.NewRequest(method, url, strings.NewReader(payload))
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	req.Header.Add("Accept", "application/json, text/plain, */*")
	req.Header.Add("Content-Type", "application/json;charset=UTF-8")

	res, err := client.Do(req)
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	defer res.Body.Close()

	return nil
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement robust HTTP status code checking:

```go
func makeApiCall(payload string) error {
    // ... (previous code for client setup and request creation)

    res, err := client.Do(req)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("request failed: %w", err)
    }
    defer res.Body.Close()

    // Check for successful status code
    if res.StatusCode < 200 || res.StatusCode >= 300 {
        body, _ := ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)
        return fmt.Errorf("unexpected status code: %d, body: %s", res.StatusCode, string(body))
    }

    // Process successful response
    body, err := ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)
    if err != nil {
        return fmt.Errorf("failed to read response body: %w", err)
    }

    // Process body as needed
    fmt.Printf("Successful response: %s\n", body)

    return nil
}
```
