# Potential Arbitrary Code Execution in `api.go`

## Summary
The makeApiCall function constructs an HTTP POST request using unsanitized user-provided data.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no validation of the payload before it is sent to the external API. This opens up the potential for arbitrary code execution if a malicious payload is passed into the function.


## Impact
An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious code into the payload parameter, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server that processes the API requests.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Validate and sanitize the payload before using it in the HTTP request. Ensure that the payload data adheres to the expected format and does not contain any malicious content.
