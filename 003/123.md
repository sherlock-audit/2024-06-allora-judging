# `msg_server_registerations::Register` will overwrite reputerInfo, which can be used to sabotage other reputers

## Summary

Reputer information in the `reputers` Map can be overwritten.
An adversary may abuse it to exclude reputers' report from the payloads by other honest reputer head nodes.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `allora-inference-base`'s `appchain::SendReputerModeData`, the leader node will call the allora chain to get the other reputer's information via `GetReputerAddressByP2PKey`:

The `Address` of the resulting reputer info will be used to ignore multiple entries from the same address.
Specifically, the node will include only the first entry per address.
It means if multiple peers have the same allora address in the allora chain via `GetReputerAddressByP2PKey`, only first entry from the peers will be included by the leader node.

The `GetReputerAddressByP2PKey` from allora-chain returns  the `Owner` address from the `reputers` Map:

On the `allora-chain`, one can register a reputer via `Register` transaction. It will eventually trigger `msg_server_registrations::Register` function.

In the `Register` function `msg_register.Validate` will be called and it will validate that the length of `LibP2PKey`.

After the registration fee is paid, `InsertReputer` will be called: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/keeper/msgserver/msg_server_registrations.go#L50

Which will update the `topicReputers` KeySet and `reputers` Map.

In the case that there is already an entry for the given `LibP2PKey`, it will overwrite the existing entry with the new information.

If somebody puts the same owner address for multiple `LibP2PKey`, only one of these peers will be included in the reputer payload.

Also, the `Owner` address does not need to be the Sender's address, so it can be set to any address.


## Impact

An adversary can sabotage other reputers.
