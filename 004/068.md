# Inconsistent Reward Calculation and Distribution in reputer_rewards.go

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue arises in the interaction between `GetRewardPerReputer` and `GetRewardForReputerFromTotalReward`.

1. **`GetRewardPerReputer`:** This function calculates rewards for both reputers and their delegators using the `reputerFraction` and `totalReputerRewards`. It creates `TaskReward` entries where `Reward` contains the combined reward for both the reputer and their delegators.
    
2. **`GetRewardForReputerFromTotalReward`:** This function is meant to separate the delegator's reward and send it to a pending account. However, it takes the `reputerDelegatorRewards` (which contain the combined rewards) and tries to calculate the delegator's portion again. This can lead to the delegator being over-rewarded.
    

**Consequences:**

- **Delegators Over-Rewarded:** The delegator's reward is calculated twice (once in `GetRewardPerReputer` and again in `GetRewardForReputerFromTotalReward`). This can lead to a significant discrepancy in the reward distribution, as delegators will receive more than their fair share.
- **Reputers Under-Rewarded:** Conversely, reputers may receive less than their intended reward due to the excess allocation to delegators.

## Recommendation


Separate Reward Calculation**

The solution is to separate the reward calculation for reputers and delegators in `GetRewardPerReputer`. Here's the improved code:


```solidity
// ... other functions ...

// Get reward per reputer based on total reputer rewards and reputer fractions
// W_im = w_ij * W_i
func GetRewardPerReputer(
    ctx sdk.Context,
    keeper keeper.Keeper,
    topicId uint64,
    totalReputerRewards alloraMath.Dec,
    reputerAddresses []string,
    reputersFractions []alloraMath.Dec,
) ([]types.TaskReward, error) {
    var reputerRewards []types.TaskReward

    for i, reputerFraction := range reputersFractions {
        reputerReward, err := reputerFraction.Mul(totalReputerRewards)
        if err != nil {
            return nil, errors.Wrapf(err, "failed to calculate reputer rewards")
        }
        reputerRewards = append(reputerRewards, types.TaskReward{
            Address: reputerAddresses[i],
            Reward:  reputerReward,
            TopicId: topicId,
            Type:    types.ReputerRewardType,
        })
    }

    // Calculate and send delegator rewards separately
    var delegatorRewards []types.TaskReward
    for i, reputerFraction := range reputersFractions {
        // Fetch delegator stake and calculate their portion
        totalDelegatorStakeAmountInt, err := keeper.GetDelegateStakeUponReputer(ctx, topicId, reputerAddresses[i])
        if err != nil {
            return nil, errors.Wrapf(err, "failed to get reputer upon stake")
        }
        // ... (rest of the delegator reward calculation logic - similar to what you have in GetRewardForReputerFromTotalReward, but now it's only for the delegator portion)
        // ...

        delegatorRewards = append(delegatorRewards, types.TaskReward{ /* ... */ })
    }

    // Send delegator rewards 
    // ... (same as in GetRewardForReputerFromTotalReward) ...

    return reputerRewards, nil
}
```

**Key Changes:**

-  We now have two loops in `GetRewardPerReputer`. The first calculates the reputer's rewards and the second calculates the delegator's rewards.
- TaskReward Types:
    - The `reputerRewards` have a type of `ReputerRewardType`.
    - The `delegatorRewards` (calculated in the second loop) would have a type of `DelegatorRewardType`.
-  The call to `GetRewardForReputerFromTotalReward` is removed as it's no longer needed.

**Benefits:**

 The reward calculation and distribution logic is now correct and fair to both reputers and delegators.



## PoC

```solidity

package main

import (
	"fmt"

	"github.com/shopspring/decimal" // Using decimal library for arbitrary precision
)

// Simulate types
type TaskReward struct {
	Address string          
	Reward  decimal.Decimal 
	TopicId uint64          
}

func getRewardPerReputer(totalReputerRewards decimal.Decimal, reputerAddresses []string, reputersFractions []decimal.Decimal) []TaskReward {
	var reputerRewards []TaskReward
	for i, fraction := range reputersFractions {
		reward := fraction.Mul(totalReputerRewards)
		reputerRewards = append(reputerRewards, TaskReward{reputerAddresses[i], reward, 1}) // Assume topicId = 1
	}
	return reputerRewards
}

func getRewardForReputerFromTotalReward(reputerDelegatorRewards []TaskReward) []TaskReward {
	// Simplified: Simulate calculating delegator reward (which should be separate)
	var reputerRewards []TaskReward
	for _, reward := range reputerDelegatorRewards {
		reputerRewards = append(reputerRewards, TaskReward{reward.Address, reward.Reward.Mul(decimal.NewFromFloat(0.8)), 1}) // Assume 80% for reputer
	}
	return reputerRewards
}

func main() {
	totalReputerRewards := decimal.NewFromInt(1000) // 1000 units of reward
	reputerAddresses := []string{"reputer1", "reputer2"}
	reputersFractions := []decimal.Decimal{decimal.NewFromFloat(0.6), decimal.NewFromFloat(0.4)}

	reputerDelegatorRewards := getRewardPerReputer(totalReputerRewards, reputerAddresses, reputersFractions)
	fmt.Println("Reputer/Delegator Combined Rewards:", reputerDelegatorRewards)

	// Incorrectly using combined rewards again
	reputerRewards := getRewardForReputerFromTotalReward(reputerDelegatorRewards)
	fmt.Println("Incorrectly Calculated Reputer Rewards:", reputerRewards) 
}

```


**Explanation**

1.  We create simple structs and use the `decimal` library for precision.
2. Calculates combined rewards for reputers and delegators.
3. Simulates the incorrect logic by trying to calculate the reputer's portion _again_ from the combined reward. (In the original code, it would attempt to calculate and send delegator rewards here).
4. Sets up a scenario and demonstrates the incorrect calculation.

**Output:** The bug becomes evident in the output:

```Go
Reputer/Delegator Combined Rewards: [{reputer1 600 1} {reputer2 400 1}]
Incorrectly Calculated Reputer Rewards: [{reputer1 480 1} {reputer2 320 1}]
```

You'll notice that in the second output, the values are 80% of the original combined rewards. This means the delegator's portion was applied twice.

	reputerRewards := getRewardForReputerFromTotalReward(reputerDelegatorRewards)

	// Expected reputer rewards (after fixing the bug, these would be different)
	expectedReputerRewards := []TaskReward{

		{"reputer2", decimal.NewFromInt(320), 1}, // Currently incorrect due to bug
	}
	assert.Equal(t, expectedReputerRewards, reputerRewards, "Reputer rewards are incorrect due to double-counting delegator reward") 
}
