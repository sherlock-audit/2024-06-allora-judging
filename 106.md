# Actors can game the withdraw waiting time

## Summary
Actors can keep a withdrawal request scheduled all the time, which enables them to cut the withdrawal waiting time in half (or more).

## Vulnerability Detail
As the README explains, participants who have scheduled a withdrawal still fully participate in the system.
> When stake is withdrawn, it still has the effect of being active so the consequences of placing stake there are fully felt. You can cancel a stake withdrawal at any time.

This is actually implemented in the code, as [RemoveStake](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/keeper/msgserver/msg_server_stake.go#L61) (inside `msg_server_stake`) only records the removal and [RemoveStakes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/stake_removals.go#L13) (inside `stake_removals`) does the system changes.

This enables users to always have a withdrawal scheduled and cancel it just before it gets executed if they want to stay, and let it execute if they want to leave. This will cut the waiting period significantly. Here are two examples:

1. User1 has a withdrawal request running constantly. He cancels it just before it gets executed and makes a new one.
2. User2 is staking normally and makes the withdrawal request when he wants to leave.

At time T, both users decide to leave because of some event, either inside or outside the system. User1 will already have his withdrawal request at N% completed (where N is between 0% and 100%, average 50%), and User2 will have his withdrawal request at 0% (he just made one). 

## Impact
Users can game the withdrawal system by having a withdrawal constantly scheduled.

## Code Snippet
```go
//@audit The user can still act on the system, like he never made a withdraw request
func (ms msgServer) RemoveStake(ctx context.Context, msg *types.MsgRemoveStake) (*types.MsgRemoveStakeResponse, error) {
	if msg.Amount.IsZero() {
		return nil, types.ErrReceivedZeroAmount
	}

	stakePlaced, err := ms.k.GetStakeReputerAuthority(ctx, msg.TopicId, msg.Sender)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	delegateStakeUponReputerInTopic, err := ms.k.GetDelegateStakeUponReputer(ctx, msg.TopicId, msg.Sender)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	reputerStakeInTopicWithoutDelegateStake := stakePlaced.Sub(delegateStakeUponReputerInTopic)
	if msg.Amount.GT(reputerStakeInTopicWithoutDelegateStake) {
		return nil, types.ErrInsufficientStakeToRemove
	}

	moduleParams, err := ms.k.GetParams(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	sdkCtx := sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(ctx)
	removal, found, err := ms.k.GetStakeRemovalForReputerAndTopicId(sdkCtx, msg.Sender, msg.TopicId)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, errorsmod.Wrap(err, "error while searching previous stake removal")
	}

	if found {
		err = ms.k.DeleteStakeRemoval(ctx, removal.BlockRemovalCompleted, removal.TopicId, removal.Reputer)
		if err != nil {
			return nil, errorsmod.Wrap(err, "failed to delete previous stake removal")
		}
	}

	stakeToRemove := types.StakeRemovalInfo{
		BlockRemovalStarted:   sdkCtx.BlockHeight(),
		BlockRemovalCompleted: sdkCtx.BlockHeight() + moduleParams.RemoveStakeDelayWindow,
		TopicId:               msg.TopicId,
		Reputer:               msg.Sender,
		Amount:                msg.Amount,
	}

	err = ms.k.SetStakeRemoval(ctx, stakeToRemove)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}
	return &types.MsgRemoveStakeResponse{}, nil
}
```
## Tool Used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
This is an issue in many protocols with withdrawal queues. A general solution is to keep their commitment (the stake can be impacted), but remove their rights (they can't act on the system).
