# Lack of Validation in Encoding and Decoding in `math/collections.go`


## Summary
No validation in encoding and decoding can opens the risk to malformed or malicious data beeing passed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `Encode`, `Decode`, `EncodeJSON`, and `DecodeJSON` methods do not perform any validation on the input or output data. This lack of validation can lead to incorrect encoding/decoding results or potential security vulnerabilities if malformed data is processed.


## Impact
Without validation, there is a risk that malformed or malicious data could be encoded or decoded incorrectly, leading to data corruption or security issues such as denial of service or exploitation of underlying vulnerabilities.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement validation checks in the Encode, Decode, EncodeJSON, and DecodeJSON methods to ensure the data being processed is valid. This will help prevent encoding/decoding errors and potential security issues.
