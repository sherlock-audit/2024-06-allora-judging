# Failed stake removals and failed delegate stake removals are not replayable

## Summary

Stake removal and delegate stake removal can fail due to several reasons, but there is no mechanism to replay a failing one.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a reputer calls `RemoveStake` at block N, a stake removal request is registered.
It will be executed after a delay window (X blocks). The stake removal execution will be automatic at
block **N+X**. (The same applies to `RemoveDelegateStake`)

The stake removals requests are executed at the end of a block in the `RemoveStakes` function.
This function will execute all stake removals for the current block.

When one of the stake removals fail, this stake removal request is not removed for a potential execution in the future.
However, there is no mechanism to execute a stake removal that has failed in a previous block.


## Impact

Stake removals and delegate stake removals can be locked after the delay window.

## Code Snippet

The `EndBlocker` function allows executing code out of block.
It calls `RemoveStakes`. See [abci.go#L22-L23](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/abci.go#L22-L23).

```go
func EndBlocker(ctx context.Context, am AppModule) error {
	// ...

	// Remove Stakers that have been wanting to unstake this block. They no longer get paid rewards
	RemoveStakes(sdkCtx, blockHeight, am.keeper)
	RemoveDelegateStakes(sdkCtx, blockHeight, am.keeper)

	// ...
}
```

Then, `RemoveStakes` retrieves all stake removals for the current block.
It executes the stake removal in a for loop. If one is failing, this one is not removed.

See [stake_removals.go#L13-L63](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/stake_removals.go#L13-L63).

```go
// Remove all stakes this block that have been marked for removal
func RemoveStakes(
	sdkCtx sdk.Context,
	currentBlock int64,
	k emissionskeeper.Keeper,
) {
	removals, err := k.GetStakeRemovalsForBlock(sdkCtx, currentBlock) // @POC: Retrieves all stake removals for CURRENT block only
	if err != nil {
		sdkCtx.Logger().Error(fmt.Sprintf(
			"Unable to get stake removals for block %d, skipping removing stakes: %v",
			currentBlock,
			err,
		))
		return
	}
	for _, stakeRemoval := range removals {
		// do no checking that the stake removal struct is valid. In order to have a stake removal
		// it would have had to be created in msgServer.RemoveStake which would have done
		// validation of validity up front before scheduling the delay

		// Check the module has enough funds to send back to the sender
		// Bank module does this for us in module SendCoins / subUnlockedCoins so we don't need to check // @POC: The module may not have enough funds as shows the comment
		// Send the funds
		coins := sdk.NewCoins(sdk.NewCoin(chainParams.DefaultBondDenom, stakeRemoval.Amount))
		err = k.SendCoinsFromModuleToAccount(sdkCtx, emissionstypes.AlloraStakingAccountName, stakeRemoval.Reputer, coins)
		if err != nil {
			sdkCtx.Logger().Error(fmt.Sprintf(
				"Error removing stake: %v | %v",
				stakeRemoval,
				err,
			))
			continue // @POC: If the stake removal fails, continue
		}

		// Update the stake data structures
		err = k.RemoveReputerStake( // @POC: Remove the reputer stake removal request if transfer success
			sdkCtx,
			currentBlock,
			stakeRemoval.TopicId,
			stakeRemoval.Reputer,
			stakeRemoval.Amount,
		) // @POC: WARNING: If the removal fails, tokens are still transfered and the stake removal request is not deleted
		if err != nil {
			sdkCtx.Logger().Error(fmt.Sprintf(
				"Error removing stake: %v | %v",
				stakeRemoval,
				err,
			))
			continue
		}
	}
}
```

The same applies to `RemoveDelegateStakes` which retrieves all delegate stake removals for the current block.
If one is failing, this one is not removed.

See [stake_removals.go#L66-L118](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/stake_removals.go#L66-L118).

---

Once a stake removal or a delegate stake removal has failed once (for example, due to a lack of balance),
the failing one will never be replayable because there is no mechanism to do so.


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

New message entrypoints should be added to execute stake removals and delegate stake removals that failed
in a previous block. For example, `ExecutePreviousRemoveStake` and `ExecutePreviousRemoveDelegateStake`.

*Note: The pattern "transfer tokens then delete stake request" in `RemoveStakes` and `RemoveDelegateStakes` is pretty unsafe
as if the deletion fails, the tokens are still transfered and the stake removal request is not deleted.*
