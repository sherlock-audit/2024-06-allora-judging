# Race Condition in Goroutine Handling in topics_handler.go

## Summary

Race Condition in Goroutine Handling in topics_handler.go

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/app/topics_handler.go#L131


## Details

The main issue lies in how the `PrepareProposalHandler` function uses goroutines within a loop:


```Go
for _, churnableTopicId := range churnableTopics {
    wg.Add(1)
    go func(topicId TopicId) {
        defer wg.Done()
        // ... (topic processing logic)
    }(churnableTopicId)
}
wg.Wait()
```

This code creates a goroutine for each `churnableTopicId` and uses a `sync.WaitGroup` (`wg`) to wait for all goroutines to finish before returning the response. However, there's a subtle race condition due to how the `topicId` variable is captured by the goroutine closure.

**Why It's a Problem**

- **Closure Variable Capture:** Go's closures capture variables by reference. This means each goroutine is sharing the same `topicId` variable. Since the loop iterates quickly, the value of `topicId` can change before a goroutine gets a chance to use it. This leads to unpredictable behavior, as multiple goroutines might end up processing the same (likely the last) topic.
    
- **Incorrect Result:** The intended behavior is for each goroutine to process a unique topic. Due to the race condition, some topics might not be processed at all, while others might be processed multiple times, leading to incorrect results.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

**Pass by Value**

To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that each goroutine gets its own copy of the `topicId` variable. we can achieve this by passing the variable by value to the goroutine closure:


```Go
for _, topicId := range churnableTopics {
    wg.Add(1)
    // Create a new variable `topicIdCopy` for each iteration
    topicIdCopy := topicId 
    go func(topicId TopicId) { 
        defer wg.Done()
        // ... (use topicId within the goroutine)
    }(topicIdCopy) // Pass the copy to the goroutine
}
wg.Wait()
```

By creating a copy (`topicIdCopy`) within the loop and passing that copy to the goroutine, each goroutine now operates on its own unique value, preventing the race condition.



```Go

func (th *TopicsHandler) PrepareProposalHandler() sdk.PrepareProposalHandler {
    return func(ctx sdk.Context, req *abci.RequestPrepareProposal) (*abci.ResponsePrepareProposal, error) {
        // ... (previous code)

        var wg sync.WaitGroup
        for _, topicId := range churnableTopics {
            wg.Add(1)
            topicIdCopy := topicId // Create a copy
            go func(topicId TopicId) {
                defer wg.Done()
                topic, err := th.emissionsKeeper.GetTopic(ctx, topicId)
                if err != nil {
                    Logger(ctx).Error("Error getting topic: " + err.Error())
                    return
                }
                th.requestTopicWorkers(ctx, topic)
                th.requestTopicReputers(ctx, topic)
            }(topicIdCopy) // Pass the copy to the goroutine
        }
        wg.Wait()

        // ... (rest of the code)
    }
}
```

**Key Improvements**

- **Race Condition Elimination:** The fix ensures that each goroutine processes a unique topic, avoiding potential conflicts and ensuring correct results .. By eliminating the race condition, the concurrent execution of tasks becomes more reliable and predictable.



## PoC 


```Go

package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "sync"
    "time"

    sdk "github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/types"
    abci "github.com/cometbft/cometbft/abci/types"
)

// ... (other necessary types and functions from the original code)

type TestTopicsHandler struct {
    processedTopics []uint64
    mutex           sync.Mutex
}

func (th *TestTopicsHandler) requestTopicWorkers(ctx sdk.Context, topic emissionstypes.Topic) {
    th.mutex.Lock()
    th.processedTopics = append(th.processedTopics, topic.Id)
    th.mutex.Unlock()
    time.Sleep(10 * time.Millisecond) // Simulate some work
}

func (th *TestTopicsHandler) requestTopicReputers(ctx sdk.Context, topic emissionstypes.Topic) {
    // Not used in this PoC
}

func (th *TestTopicsHandler) PrepareProposalHandler() sdk.PrepareProposalHandler {
    return func(ctx sdk.Context, req *abci.RequestPrepareProposal) (*abci.ResponsePrepareProposal, error) {
        churnableTopics := []uint64{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} // Sample topic IDs

        var wg sync.WaitGroup
        for _, topicId := range churnableTopics {
            wg.Add(1)
            go func(topicId uint64) { // Note: topicId is passed by value
                defer wg.Done()
                topic := emissionstypes.Topic{Id: topicId} // Simplified topic
                th.requestTopicWorkers(ctx, topic)
            }(topicId)
        }
        wg.Wait()

        fmt.Println("Processed Topics:", th.processedTopics)
        return &abci.ResponsePrepareProposal{Txs: req.Txs}, nil
    }
}

func main() {
    handler := &TestTopicsHandler{}
    ctx := sdk.Context{}
    req := &abci.RequestPrepareProposal{}

    _, err := handler.PrepareProposalHandler()(ctx, req)
    if err != nil {
        fmt.Println("Error:", err)
    }
}
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Simplified Topics:** The PoC uses a simplified `Topic` struct and a list of sample topic IDs (`churnableTopics`).
2. **TestTopicsHandler:** A modified handler that tracks processed topics and simulates some work with `time.Sleep`.
3. **Mutex Protection:** The `processedTopics` slice is protected by a mutex to prevent concurrent write issues.
4. **Goroutines:** The `PrepareProposalHandler` launches goroutines to process each topic.
5. **Topic ID Passing:** Crucially, the `topicId` is passed by _value_ to the goroutine closure to avoid the race condition.

**Output:**

When we run this code, you'll see that the outputted `processedTopics` slice contains all the topic IDs in the correct order. This demonstrates that each goroutine correctly processed its own unique `topicId` without any race condition issues.

If we remove the line `topicIdCopy := topicId` and pass `topicId` directly to the goroutine, we will observe that some topic IDs are missing or repeated in the output, indicating the presence of the race condition.

This PoC clearly shows the potential for incorrect behavior due to the race condition and how passing the `topicId` by value effectively resolves the issue.
