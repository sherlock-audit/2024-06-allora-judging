# Negative Stake & DelegateStek Amounts Causes Runtime Panic

## Summary
The Allora AppChain's staking mechanism allows for negative stake amounts to be processed. This issue arises from the absence of checks for negative values in the AddStake and AddDelegateStake functions. When a negative stake amount is provided, the system panics at runtime, this might lead to an unexpected behavior

## Vulnerability Detail
n the Allora AppChain, the functions `AddStake` and `AddDelegateStake` are responsible for adding stakes to become a reputer and delegating stakes to a reputer, respectively. Both functions include checks to ensure that the amount is not zero. However, there is no check to prevent negative values from being processed. This oversight can lead to runtime panics when a negative stake amount is provided, temporarily disrupting the normal operation of the network.

```js
// Function for reputers to call to add stake to an existing stake position.
func (ms msgServer) AddStake(ctx context.Context, msg *types.MsgAddStake) (*types.MsgAddStakeResponse, error) {
    if msg.Amount.IsZero() {
        return nil, types.ErrReceivedZeroAmount
    }
    
// Delegates a stake to a reputer. Sender need not be registered to delegate stake.
func (ms msgServer) DelegateStake(ctx context.Context, msg *types.MsgDelegateStake) (*types.MsgDelegateStakeResponse, error) {
    if msg.Amount.IsZero() {
        return nil, types.ErrReceivedZeroAmount
    }
```
## Impact
Leads to a runtime panic which may cause unexpected or undefined behaviour.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to implement a check for negative stake amounts in both the `AddStake` and `AddDelegateStake` functions.
