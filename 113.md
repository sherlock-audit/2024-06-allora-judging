# Malicious Whitelist Admin can prevent itself from being deleted

## Summary
Malicious Whitelist Admin can prevent itself from being deleted

## Vulnerability Detail
Adding a Whitelist Admin checks whether the admin is in the list, and removing the Whitelist also checks whether the admin is in the list.

After an admin is added to the admin list, you can add or remove other admins.

If there is an admin who is malicious, he can make himself never removed by:
1. Add one of his other accounts to the admin list, and if he is removed, he will be added back to the other account.

2. If he finds that another admin(adminX) wants to remove himself, he will remove adminX first. After adminX is removed, he cannot remove himself without permission.

## Impact
Malicious Admin cannot be deleted
