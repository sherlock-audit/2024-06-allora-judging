# math miscalculation artificially deflates scores

## Summary
When [GetConsensusScore](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/rewards_internal.go#L309) calculates a score, it has a chance to artificially deflate the value, due to a a check the changes `consensusLosses` from 0 to `epsilon`.

## Vulnerability Detail



## How scores are calculated
[GetConsensusScore](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/rewards_internal.go#L309) calculates scores using the bellow formula:

$$
\frac{1}{\left(\frac{\sqrt{\sum (rLoss - \text{consensusLosses})^2}}{\sqrt{\sum \text{consensusLosses}^2}}\right) + \text{tolerance}}
$$

Also represented as: 
```markdown
1 / (Sqrt(sum((rLoss - consensusLosses)^2)) / Sqrt(sum(consensusLosses^2)) + tolerance)
```

Breaking it down, we can find that `Sqrt(sum(consensusLosses^2))` is just the square root of all `consensusLosses * consensusLosses`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/rewards_internal.go#L322-L335
```go
	for _, cLoss := range consensusLosses {
		cLossSquared, err := cLoss.Mul(cLoss)
		if err != nil {
			return alloraMath.ZeroDec(), err
		}

		sumConsensusSquared, err = sumConsensusSquared.Add(cLossSquared)

		if err != nil {
			return alloraMath.ZeroDec(), err
		}
	}
	// Sqrt(sum(consensusLosses^2))
	consensusNorm, err := sumConsensusSquared.Sqrt()
```

And `(Sqrt(sum((rLoss - consensusLosses)^2))` is the same thing, but with 1 caveat, it's not `consensusLosses`, but `rLoss - consensusLosses`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/rewards_internal.go#L338-L366
```go
	for i, rLoss := range reputerLosses {
                ...
		rLossLessConsensusLoss, err := rLoss.Sub(consensusLosses[i])
		if err != nil {
			return alloraMath.ZeroDec(), err
		}

		rLossLessCLossSquared, err := rLossLessConsensusLoss.Mul(rLossLessConsensusLoss) // == Pow(x,2)
		if err != nil {
			return alloraMath.ZeroDec(), err
		}

		distanceSquared, err = distanceSquared.Add(rLossLessCLossSquared)
		if err != nil {
			return alloraMath.ZeroDec(), err
		}
	}

	distance, err := distanceSquared.Sqrt()
	if err != nil {
		return alloraMath.ZeroDec(), err
	}
```

We can see the final part where our `distance` (`Sqrt(sum((rLoss - consensusLosses)^2))`) is divided by `consensusNorm` `Sqrt(sum(consensusLosses^2))`, where the issue takes place.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/rewards_internal.go#L367-L370
```go
	distanceOverConsensusNorm, err := distance.Quo(consensusNorm)
	if err != nil {
		return alloraMath.ZeroDec(), err
	}
```


## Where the vulnerabilities takes place

Before this division, during the for loop for calculating`distance` we have an interesting `if`, which changes the value of `consensusLosses` to `epsilon`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/rewards_internal.go#L346-L348
```go
		if consensusLosses[i].IsZero() {
			consensusLosses[i] = epsilon
		}
```

However that [if](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/rewards_internal.go#L346-L348) impacts our formula only on the left side, as `consensusNorm` is already calculated as `Sqrt(sum(consensusLosses^2))`, where one of these (or more) `consensusLosses` is 0. After this [if](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/module/rewards/rewards_internal.go#L346-L348) our right side stays the same but our left side changes from `Sqrt(sum((rLoss - 0)^2))` to `Sqrt(sum((rLoss - epsilon)^2))`

```markdown
Sqrt(sum((rLoss - consensusLosses)^2)) / Sqrt(sum(consensusLosses^2))
```

This will cause our result from the above equation to be bigger, because we didn't include if `consensusLosses == 0` then `consensusLosses = epsilon` in our divisor (`Sqrt(sum(consensusLosses^2))`). Getting this part bigger will cause our score to be smaller, since the final score is the `1 / the above formula + tolerance`

```markdown
1 / (Sqrt(sum((rLoss - consensusLosses)^2)) / Sqrt(sum(consensusLosses^2)) + tolerance)
```

## Impact
In rare cases when `consensusLosses == 0` scores are deflated, more than they should be.

## Code Snippet
```go
		if consensusLosses[i].IsZero() {
			consensusLosses[i] = epsilon
		}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the cases where `consensusLosses == 0`, make sure after setting it to `epsilon` you also include it in the `consensusNorm`.
