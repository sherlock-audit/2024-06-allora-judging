# Lack of Error Handling in Goroutines in `topics_handler.go`

## Summary
This is no proper error handler in `requestTopicWorkers` and `requestTopicReputers`.


## Vulnerability Detail
The goroutines in `requestTopicWorkers` and `requestTopicReputers` functions do not have proper error handling. If an error occurs within these goroutines, it is not captured or handled, leading to potential silent failures.

## Impact
Errors occurring within goroutines may go unnoticed, leading to silent failures and incomplete operations. This can affect the reliability and correctness of the blockchain operations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Capture and handle errors within goroutines. Use channels or other mechanisms to propagate errors back to the main execution flow and ensure they are logged and handled appropriately.
