# Logic Bug in the `QuadrupleKeyCodec` Implementation

## Vulnerability Detail

 in the `QuadrupleKeyCodec` implementation regarding how it handles nil values in the `Encode` and `Decode` methods.

**The Issue**

- **`Encode`:** When encoding a `Quadruple` key, if one of the key parts (e.g., `key.k2`) is nil, the code directly proceeds to encode the next key part using the previous `writtenTotal`. This means that no space is reserved in the `buffer` for the nil key part, leading to incorrect encoding.
    
- **`Decode`:** Similarly, during decoding, if a key part is nil, the code still attempts to decode the subsequent parts, potentially leading to data misalignment and incorrect key reconstruction.
    

## impact

This bug can lead to data corruption and inconsistencies in the underlying storage. It may cause:

- **Incorrect Key Retrieval:** When trying to retrieve a value from the store using a key that has a nil part, the decoding might fail, or the wrong value might be returned.
- **Key Collisions:** Incorrect encoding could lead to multiple logically different keys being encoded into the same byte representation, resulting in key collisions.
- **Data Loss:** In some cases, the misalignment of data during decoding could lead to data being overwritten or lost.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

we need to modify the `Encode` and `Decode` methods to correctly handle nil key parts. 
ensures that the encoded representation of the `Quadruple` key accurately reflects the presence or absence of each key part.


## PoC

```Go

package keeper_test

import (
	"fmt"
	"testing"

	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
	"github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk/collections/codec"
	"github.com/allora-network/allora-chain/x/emissions/keeper"
)

func TestQuadrupleKeyCodecNilValues(t *testing.T) {
    // Create sample key codecs for each part of the Quadruple
    stringKeyCodec := codec.StringKeyCodec{}
    uint64KeyCodec := codec.Uint64KeyCodec{}
    boolKeyCodec := codec.BoolKeyCodec{}

    // Create a QuadrupleKeyCodec
    quadrupleKeyCodec := keeper.QuadrupleKeyCodec(stringKeyCodec, uint64KeyCodec, boolKeyCodec, stringKeyCodec) // Note the nil value for k3

    // Create a Quadruple key with a nil value in the third part
    key := keeper.Join4("part1", uint64(123), nil, "part4") 

    // Encode the key
    encoded, err := quadrupleKeyCodec.Encode(nil, key)
    assert.NoError(t, err)

    // Decode the key
    _, decoded, err := quadrupleKeyCodec.Decode(encoded)
    assert.NoError(t, err)

    // Assertion to demonstrate the incorrect decoding
    expectedDecoded := keeper.Join4("part1", uint64(123), nil, "part4") // The third part should still be nil
    assert.Equal(t, expectedDecoded, decoded, "Decoded key does not match the original key") 
}

```

**Explanation**

1. Creates basic key codecs for strings, uint64, and booleans.
2. Creates a `QuadrupleKeyCodec` using the sample codecs.
3. Creates a `Quadruple` key where the third part (`k3`) is intentionally set to nil.
4. Encodes the key using the `QuadrupleKeyCodec`.
5. Decodes the encoded bytes back into a `Quadruple` key.
6.  Asserts that the decoded key is equal to the original key, including the nil value in the third part. This assertion should fail with the original buggy `QuadrupleKeyCodec` implementation.

**Expected Output**

The test should initially fail due to the incorrect handling of the nil value in the original `QuadrupleKeyCodec.Encode` and `QuadrupleKeyCodec.Decode` methods.
