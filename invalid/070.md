# Inconsistent Topic Deactivation In `topic_rewards.go`

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue lies in how the code handles inactive topics within the `GetAndUpdateActiveTopicWeights` function. Specifically, there's a mismatch between when a topic is identified as inactive and when it's actually deactivated.

Here's the problematic sequence:

1. *Inside the `fn` (anonymous function) that processes each topic, if the `weight` is below the `moduleParams.MinTopicWeight`, the topic is considered inactive and added to `nowInactiveTopics`. However, the function continues, potentially adding the topic's weight to the `sumWeight`.
2. After processing all topics, the code attempts to deactivate the topics in `nowInactiveTopics`.


## impact

This inconsistency can lead to the following issues:

- **Incorrect Reward Calculation:** If an inactive topic's weight is added to `sumWeight`, it will affect the reward fraction calculation for other topics. This can result in inaccurate reward distributions.
- **Delayed Deactivation:** Topics might remain active for longer than intended due to the delayed deactivation. This can lead to them receiving rewards even when they should be inactive.

## Recommendation

We can resolve this by deactivating a topic as soon as it's identified as inactive within the `fn` function.
