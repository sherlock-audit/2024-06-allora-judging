# The worker and reputer's payload may be tampered due to lack of check for the pubkey's ownership

## Summary

`InsertBulkWorkerPayload` and `InsertBulkReputerPayload` does not check the ownership of the pubkey.
As the result, the data from worker or reputer may be tampered.

## Vulnerability Detail

Each worker signs their data and the elected lead node will send the bundle to the allora chain via `InsertBulkWorkerPayload`.

And the signature is check in the `worker_data_bundle.Validate`:
It checks whether the `InferenceForecastsBundle` is signed by the private key from the given Pubkey.
However, it was not checked whether the Pubkey belongs from the inferer, who is presumably signed the bundle.
Without this check, an adversary may tamper with the data bundle and claim that the data is from an innocent inferer.
The data will then recorded as the data from the inferer.

The same issue exists in the `msg_server_losses:InsertBulkReputerPayload`.
It is checked whether the ValueBundle was signed with the private for the `Pubkey`, but it was not checked that the key should belong to the reputer.
Therefore, the value bundle may be tampered, but the data will recorded as the reputer's data.

The proof of work below demonstrates that the signature and the pubkey do not belong to the inferer:

```go
// based on msg_server_worker_payload_test.go
func (s *MsgServerTestSuite) TestMsgInsertBulkWorkerPayloadPoC() {
	ctx, msgServer := s.ctx, s.msgServer
	require := s.Require()

	workerPrivateKey := secp256k1.GenPrivKey()
	adversary := secp256k1.GenPrivKey()
  require.NotEqual(adversary, workerPrivateKey)

	workerMsg, topicId := s.setUpMsgInsertBulkWorkerPayload(workerPrivateKey)

	workerMsg = s.signMsgInsertBulkWorkerPayload(workerMsg, adversary)

	blockHeight := workerMsg.WorkerDataBundles[0].InferenceForecastsBundle.Forecast.BlockHeight

	forecastsCount0 := s.getCountForecastsAtBlock(topicId, blockHeight)

	_, err := msgServer.InsertBulkWorkerPayload(ctx, &workerMsg)
	require.NoError(err, "InsertBulkWorkerPayload should not return an error")

	forecastsCount1 := s.getCountForecastsAtBlock(topicId, blockHeight)

	require.Equal(forecastsCount0, 0)
	require.Equal(forecastsCount1, 1)
}
```

## Impact

The worker and reputer's data may be tampered and as the result, they may be punished or rewarded incorrectly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding the check for the ownership of the pubkey.
