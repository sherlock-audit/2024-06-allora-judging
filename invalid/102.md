# Malicious delegators can get more rewards than they should

## Summary

The `RemoveDelegateStake` and `AddDelegateStake` actions in the `emissions` module don't update the `delegatedStakePlacement.RewardDebt` to record the claimed reward after sending the pending reward to the delegators.

## Vulnerability Detail

When delegators remove their stake, emissions [`keeper#RemoveDelegateStake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/keeper/keeper.go#L931) calculate their pending reward then send the rewards to the delegators:

```go
func (k *Keeper) RemoveDelegateStake(
    ...
    pendingReward, err = pendingReward.Sub(delegatedStakePlacement.RewardDebt)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    if pendingReward.Gt(alloraMath.NewDecFromInt64(0)) {
        err = k.SendCoinsFromModuleToAccount(
            ctx,
            types.AlloraPendingRewardForDelegatorAccountName,
            delegator,
            sdk.NewCoins(sdk.NewCoin(params.DefaultBondDenom, pendingReward.SdkIntTrim())),
        )
        if err != nil {
            return errorsmod.Wrapf(err, "Sending pending reward to delegator failed")
        }
    }
    ....
}
```

However, the function don't update the `delegatedStakePlacement.RewardDebt` to record the claimed reward after sending the pending reward. This means that the delegators can claim the reward multiple times by removing their stake multiple times with little `msg.amount` every time.

Same issue also exists in [`AddDelegateStake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/keeper/keeper.go#L782-L811) action.

## Impact

The delegators can get more rewards than they should.

## Recommendation

Record the claimed reward after sending the reward to delegator as [`msg_server_stake#RewardDelegateStake`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/emissions/keeper/msgserver/msg_server_stake.go#L302) did.
