# Potential for Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in `topics_handler.go`

## Summary
There is no ressource consumption check in `requestTopicWorkers` and `requestTopicReputers` which can lead to dangerous scenarios.

## Vulnerability Detail
The use of goroutines in `requestTopicWorkers` and `requestTopicReputers` without proper limits can lead to uncontrolled resource consumption. If the number of topics or nonces is large, it can spawn a large number of goroutines, leading to potential resource exhaustion.


## Impact
Uncontrolled spawning of goroutines can lead to excessive resource consumption, causing performance degradation, potential crashes, or denial of service.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a mechanism to limit the number of concurrent goroutines. Use worker pools or similar constructs to control resource usage and prevent exhaustion.
