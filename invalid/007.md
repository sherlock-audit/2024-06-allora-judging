# Insufficient Address Verification in `config.go`

## Summary
The address verification function doesn't perform enough check on the address structure.

## Vulnerability Detail
The address verification function in SetAddressPrefixes only checks for specific lengths (20 and 32 bytes) and does not perform additional validation on the address structure or content.

## Impact
This limited verification might allow invalid or malformed addresses to be accepted, potentially leading to issues with address handling and validation in the application.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enhance the address verification function to include additional checks, such as ensuring the address follows a specific format or contains valid characters. This will improve the robustness of address validation.
