# Iteration over map is non-deterministic and could cause issues in consensus-critical code

## Summary
Iteration over map is non-deterministic and could cause issues in consensus-critical code
## Vulnerability Detail
[Cosmos sdk docs](https://docs.cosmos.network/main/build/building-apps/security-part-1#go-map-internals)
Under the hood, Go maps are implemented as a hash map of buckets where each bucket contains up to 8 key-value pairs. Since some key-value pairs within the bucket can be empty, Go uses randomness to select the starting element within the bucket. See [this article](https://medium.com/i0exception/map-iteration-in-go-275abb76f721) for the breakdown.

Unless aggregating the final result (e.g. summing up the values), you should never iterate over a Go map when building on the Cosmos SDK. Doing so results in non-determinism. Instead, if map usage is inevitable, it is necessary to convert it to a slice and sort it.

`regretFrac, err := worker.regret.Quo(stdDevRegretsPlusMedianTimesFTolerancePlusEpsilon)`
fails for more than 1 time then different nodes will fail with different errors, causing the chain to halt.

## Recommendation
it is necessary to convert it to a slice and sort it.
