# Non-deterministic approach to iterate over the map can result in inconsistent state between nodes and validators

## Summary

Non-deterministic approach to iterate over the map can result in inconsistent state between nodes and validators

## Vulnerability Detail

the third one applies to the current codebase:

> Iterating Over A Map

> A common example of non-determinism in Cosmos projects occurs when iterating over a ‘map’ which is analogous to a dictionary or hashmap in other programming languages. Map orderings are not deterministic. This means that if a loop is used to list the elements of a map, the loop could traverse the elements of the map in a different order for every execution even when the data in the map has not changed

the same issue is here in this [line of code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/4e1bc73db32873476f8b0a88945815d3978d931c/allora-chain/x/emissions/keeper/inference_synthesis/common.go#L37)

```solidity
func ConvertWeightsToArrays(weights map[Worker]Weight) []*types.RegretInformedWeight {
	weightsArray := make([]*types.RegretInformedWeight, 0)
	for worker, weight := range weights {
		weightsArray = append(weightsArray, &types.RegretInformedWeight{Worker: worker, Weight: weight})
	}
	return weightsArray
}

func ConvertForecastImpliedInferencesToArrays(
	forecastImpliedInferenceByWorker map[string]*types.Inference,
) []*types.WorkerAttributedValue {
	forecastImpliedInferences := make([]*types.WorkerAttributedValue, 0)
	for worker, inference := range forecastImpliedInferenceByWorker {
		forecastImpliedInferences = append(forecastImpliedInferences, &types.WorkerAttributedValue{Worker: worker, Value: inference.Value})
	}
	return forecastImpliedInferences
}
```

these function is used by:

```solidity
func (qs queryServer) GetLatestNetworkInference(
	ctx context.Context,
	req *types.QueryLatestNetworkInferencesAtBlockRequest,
) (
	*types.QueryLatestNetworkInferencesAtBlockResponse,
	error,
) {

	networkInferences, forecastImpliedInferenceByWorker, infererWeights, forecasterWeights, err := synth.GetLatestNetworkInference(
		sdk.UnwrapSDKContext(ctx),
		qs.k,
		req.TopicId,
	)
	if err != nil {
		return nil, err
	}

	return &types.QueryLatestNetworkInferencesAtBlockResponse{
		NetworkInferences:         networkInferences,
		InfererWeights:            synth.ConvertWeightsToArrays(infererWeights),
		ForecasterWeights:         synth.ConvertWeightsToArrays(forecasterWeights),
		ForecastImpliedInferences: synth.ConvertForecastImpliedInferencesToArrays(forecastImpliedInferenceByWorker),
	}, nil
}

```

calling this function first time the function could return

[(worker1, weight1), (worker2, weigh2)]

then next time the function could return 

[(worker2, weight2), (worker1, weight1)]

then the code access the array first time at index 0, the code get worker1 info,

then the code access the array second time at index 0, the code get worker2 info.

this would leads to inconsistent state between nodes for data saved from inference synthesis

## Impact

this would leads to inconsistent state between nodes for data saved from inference synthesis

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

the current code convert map to array, but the  code should iterate over array instead of maps
