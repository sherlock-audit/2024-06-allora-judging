# Non-Determinism in GetAndUpdateActiveTopicWeights Function

## Summary

The `GetAndUpdateActiveTopicWeights` function, which is executed at the end of each block in the ABCI `EndBlocker`, introduces non-determinism due to the order of iteration over active topics. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `GetAndUpdateActiveTopicWeights` function is responsible for updating the weights and related data of active topics at the end of each block. However, the current implementation relies on the `SafeApplyFuncOnAllActiveEpochEndingTopics` function to iterate over the active topics, which does not guarantee a deterministic order of iteration.

The non-determinism arises in the following aspects:
1. The order in which inactive topics are appended to the `nowInactiveTopics` slice may vary across nodes, leading to differences in the order of topics being inactivated.
2. The order of entries in the `weights` map may differ across nodes, as the order of iteration over active topics is not guaranteed to be the same.
3. The order in which the weights and revenues are accumulated may vary, potentially leading to minor discrepancies in the final values of `sumWeight` and `totalRevenue`.




## Impact

If nodes have different states, they may not reach consensus on the same block, causing the blockchain to stall or fork.

```go

// Returns the total sum of weight, topic revenue, map of all of the weights by topic.
// Note that the outputted weights are not normalized => not dependent on pan-topic data.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

 Sort the active topics based on a deterministic criterion, such as their IDs or any other stable and comparable attribute, before iterating over them.
