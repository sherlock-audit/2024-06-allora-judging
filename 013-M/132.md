# MustNewDecFromString Causing Critical ABCI Panics in Cosmos Blockchain

# Security Report: MustNewDecFromString Causing Critical ABCI Panics in Cosmos Blockchain

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security audit using CodeQL static analysis has uncovered a severe vulnerability in our Cosmos blockchain implementation. The `MustNewDecFromString` function, when used within ABCI (Application Blockchain Interface) methods, poses a medium risk of causing panics that can lead to chain halts. This report details the findings, with a particular focus on how `MustNewDecFromString` impacts critical consensus methods like `BeginBlocker` and `EndBlocker`.

It is crucial to note that panics in ABCI methods are recognized as severe security issues in the Cosmos ecosystem. According to the official Cosmos security documentation (https://github.com/crytic/building-secure-contracts/blob/master/not-so-smart-contracts/cosmos/abci_panic/README.md), such panics can lead to consensus failures and network-wide disruptions. The discovery of `MustNewDecFromString` as a source of these panics highlights an urgent need for immediate action.

## Key Findings

1. The `MustNewDecFromString` function contains a direct `panic` call that can be triggered within ABCI methods.
2. Multiple panic-inducing paths in `BeginBlocker` have been identified, often involving calls to `MustNewDecFromString` or similar functions.
3. These panics in ABCI methods pose a direct threat to blockchain stability and consensus.


### 3. Panic in `MustNewDecFromString` Function

**Severity: High**

**Location**: `dec.go:94:3`  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/math/dec.go#L91

**Description**: 
The `MustNewDecFromString` function contains a direct `panic` call, which could be triggered if the input string cannot be parsed into a decimal.

**Problematic Code**:
```go
func MustNewDecFromString(s string) Dec {
    ret, err := NewDecFromString(s)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
    return ret
}
```

**Risk**: If this function is called within ABCI methods like `BeginBlocker` or `EndBlocker`, it could cause a chain halt if the input string is invalid.

### 4. Multiple Potential Panic Paths in `BeginBlocker`

**Severity: High**

**Location**: Multiple paths within `BeginBlocker` function,  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/x/mint/module/abci.go#L105

**Description**: 
CodeQL analysis has revealed multiple paths that could lead to panics in the `BeginBlocker` function. These paths involve calls to various functions that might trigger panics, including:

- `GetParamsBlocksPerMonth`
- `GetParams`
- `DefaultParams`
- `MustNewDecFromString`

BeginBlocker code  path to MustNewDecFromString

BeginBlocker
  -> GetParamsBlocksPerMonth
  ----> GetParams
   ---------> DefaultParams
   -------------> MustNewDecFromString

The following is the code path cause panic find by codeql

**Problematic Code Snippet**:
```go
func BeginBlocker(ctx context.Context, k keeper.Keeper) error {
    // ... [other code]
    params, err := k.Params.Get(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    // ... [other code]
    blocksPerMonth, err := k.GetParamsBlocksPerMonth(ctx)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    // ... [other potentially panic-inducing calls]
}
```

**Risk**: Multiple points in this critical consensus method could lead to panics, potentially causing abrupt chain halts and network-wide disruptions.

## Additional Recommendations

In light of these new findings, we recommend the following additional measures:

8. **Refactor `MustNewDecFromString` Function**:
   - Replace the panic with an error returning mechanism.
   - Consider renaming the function to indicate it may return an error, e.g., `NewDecFromStringWithError`.

9. **Comprehensive Audit of `BeginBlocker`**:
   - Conduct a line-by-line review of the `BeginBlocker` function.
   - Identify all potential panic points and refactor to use proper error handling.

10. **Implement Panic Recovery in ABCI Methods**:
    - Wrap all ABCI method calls (including `BeginBlocker` and `EndBlocker`) with a panic recovery mechanism.
    - Log recovered panics and attempt graceful degradation where possible.

11. **Review and Refactor Utility Functions**:
    - Audit all utility functions called within ABCI methods (e.g., `GetParamsBlocksPerMonth`, `DefaultParams`).
    - Ensure these functions use error returns instead of panics for exceptional cases.

12. **Enhanced Static Analysis**:
    - Expand the use of CodeQL and other static analysis tools to regularly scan for potential panic points.
    - Implement automated checks in the CI/CD pipeline to catch panic-inducing code before it reaches production.
