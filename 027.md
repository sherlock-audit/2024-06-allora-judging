# Standard deviation calculation is biased

## Summary

The estimation of the regrets & time steps scores will be based because of a biased estimator.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `StdDev` calculates the sample standard deviation of an arbitrary data vector. To do so, it uses the formula `sqrt((Σ(x - μ))^2/ N)`. Because the data is also used to calculate the sample mean, this estimator [will be biased](https://math.oxford.emory.edu/site/math117/besselCorrection/), i.e. its expectation value will not be σ, but rather sqrt((n - 1)/n) σ.

The utility function is used in `synth_palette_weight.go` to get the std. deviation of the regrets and in `rewards_internal.go` to get the std. deviation of the latest time steps scores.

## Impact

The std. deviation estimate in the two mentioned places will be slightly off, leading to a wrong estimate.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-06-allora/blob/main/allora-chain/math/utils.go#L129
```go
	sdOverLen, err := sd.Quo(lenData)
	if err != nil {
		return Dec{}, err
	}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Apply Bessel's correction, i.e. divide by `N - 1` instead of `N`, which means subtracting one from `lenData` in the code.
